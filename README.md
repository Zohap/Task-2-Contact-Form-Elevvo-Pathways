# Task-2-Contact-Form-Elevvo-Pathways


This repository contains Task 2 of my front-end development practice, which focuses on creating a fully functional and visually appealing Contact Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes input fields for name, email, subject, and message, and features client-side validation to ensure that users enter valid and complete information before submission.

The layout is responsive and adjusts well across different screen sizes. The design includes smooth hover and focus effects to enhance the user experience. While this version uses only front-end technologies, it is ready to be integrated with a back-end server or third-party service (such as Formspree or EmailJS) to process submissions.

This project helped reinforce key front-end skills such as DOM manipulation, form validation, and responsive design. It serves as a solid base for real-world contact forms in portfolio websites, business pages, or any interactive web application.

To run this project locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. The source code is organized into three files: `index.html` for structure, `style.css` for styling, and `script.js` for functionality. A screenshot or live demo link can be added for reference.

Feel free to explore, use, or improve the form. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
